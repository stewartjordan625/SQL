-In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that contains Netflix data to answer questions about the data.

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)

SELECT COUNT(titles.type) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles 
WHERE "type" = 'Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?

SELECT MAX(titles.date_added) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles;

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.

SELECT titles.title 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles 
ORDER BY title asc;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?

SELECT people.director, titles.title 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people 
LEFT OUTER JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles ON people.show_id=titles.show_id 
WHERE titles.title='Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?

SELECT titles.title,titles.release_year 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles 
ORDER BY release_year LIMIT 1;
